A simple to use API wrapper for the Discord REST API in Python

## What is Zenora

Zenora is a synchronous library for accessing the Discord REST API. It allows you to access the API without async/await. And also gives you REST-only API access, not the gateway. Pretty useful for making bot web dashboards, or desktop applications, etc. There's some Oauth features as well

## Installation

Install from Git

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ahnaf-zamil/zenora
```

or install with pip

```bash
pip install Zenora
```

## Basic Usage

```python
from zenora import APIClient

client = APIClient(token="...")
# There is also a set_token method which can be used to replace the token later on

# Make API request to get the currently logged in user object
user = client.users.get_current_user()

# Use the data :D
print(user.username)
```

## Using Oauth

Zenora has can be used for accessing the Discord Oauth API (WIP). It is very simple to use, and reduces a lot
of the hassle for implementing Discord Oauth in your application. But before you do try out Zenora, you need to
know how to use get the authorization code from the Discord API in order to use it (this is mandatory and cannot be
avoided as Zenora depends on that code in order to get the access token).

Link: https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#authorization-code-grant

Once you have the authorization code, Zenora will do the rest of the work for you. Just call some functions and you will get your
access token and will be able to use that to with the Discord API.

Example:

```py
from zenora import APIClient

TOKEN = "Your bot's token"
client = APIClient(
    TOKEN,
    client_secret="Your bot's client secret",
)

oauth_url = "your oauth redirect uri"

...

code = "the authorization code that you get from the Discord API everytime someone uses your Oauth application"

access_token = client.oauth.get_access_token(
    code, redirect_uri=oauth_url
).access_token


# Setting it to bearer because we are using Oauth here
bearer_client = APIClient(access_token, bearer=True)

# Query the user object that has used your Oauth application
user = bearer_client.users.get_current_user()

print(user) # Prints it out :)
```

If you want to know how to use Oauth with a specific web framework, check out the [**Examples** section](https://github.com/ahnaf-zamil/zenora/tree/master/examples) of the repository.
